# Reactive Streams

##Reactive Streams

http://www.reactive-streams.org/

Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure on the JVM.
The scope of Reactive Streams is to find a minimal set of interfaces and methods that will describe the necessary operations and entities to achieve the goalâ€”asynchronous streams of data with non-blocking back pressure.

The specification is composed of three parts:


 - Semantics: a specification document
 - API: Java interfaces for implementations
 - TCK: a test harness to validate implementations and guide implementors
