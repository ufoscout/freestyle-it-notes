**Back pressure**
It refers to pressure opposed to the desired flow of a fluid in a confined place such as a pipe. It can for example be caused by obstructions.
In information technology the term is also used analogously to describe the build-up of data behind an I/O switch if the buffers are full and incapable of receiving any more data; the transmitting device halts the sending of data packets until the buffers have been emptied and are once more capable of storing information.
